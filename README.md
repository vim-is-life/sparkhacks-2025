DESCRIPTION:

Wether you are searching for new food to try, getting a haircut, or getting your phone fixed, TideTogether provides a solution for informing users new small businesses that are new and low-key. 

Entering into the home page you'll have the chance to create an account either as a user or as a business. Continuing as a business you can upload the location where you set up shop or are located and some accompanying images to show users the sort of service you provide. As a user, after having created your account you will be able to load onto the main page where you will be met with a map pinned with a number of small businesses in your vicinity which you can click on and explore further!
